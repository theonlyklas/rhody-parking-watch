The purpose of our app is to identify open parking spots in URI parking lots. By identifying open spots, users will be able to find a parking spot in a timely manner. First we will establish a working app that utilizes the camera on a smartphone which, when pointed at a birds eye view image of a parking lot, will recognize which spots are taken, which are free, and how many people are currently driving around looking for parking. Ultimately, we could apply this technology to parking lots in other locations to help people find parking. This app would be useful to students, faculty, and any visitors using these parking lots.
