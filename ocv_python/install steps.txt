http://docs.opencv.org/3.2.0/ Use this for tutorials

1. Install Python 3.5 (3.6 might work as well, can't confirm, but anything before 3.3 won't work)

2. Change windows environmental path to include Python35 and Python35/Scripts directories to be able to use pip (probably not needed on Mac and Linux, I can't verify):

3. From an admin command line/terminal, run these commands anywhere (only needs to be done once):
pip install opencv-python
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy

4. Run the test_ORB.py file

(COMPLETELY OPTIONAL AND I HAVEN'T TRIED THIS YET) To test out SIFT and SURF algorithms:
git clone both the opencv AND opencv_contrib repositories
follow cmake instructions
compile the library

^it's a patented image recognition algorithm so I'm avoiding it tbh
